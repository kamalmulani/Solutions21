How about creating your own problem statement? &nbsp Sounds Interesting? Let’s see…<br><br>The participants will be assigned a random part of the house based on our algorithm and they have to create their own problem statement for that part of your house (for example-  In the kitchen a problem statement could be automation of exhaust fans). You'll have to work on providing an efficient solution to the problem. Keep in mind, someone might think alike, so the more unique your solution is the more chances of your winning are.",
